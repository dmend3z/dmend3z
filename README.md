# Hey, I’m Daniel

I build software with purpose  
I test business ideas to learn what works and what doesn’t  

I’m a Senior Software Engineer from Porto, currently living in Cyprus  
Most days I’m writing code, launching projects, and refining ideas through real feedback  
I like things simple, fast, and useful

## What I’m focused on

Writing full-stack code with TypeScript, Next.js, NestJS and PostgreSQL  
Using AI and automation where it actually helps  
Building products in public with a clear goal  
Testing small ideas to find what creates value  

## How I think

The product matters more than the stack  
Shipping beats perfection  
Good code is code you understand a month later  
AI is just another tool — the hard part is still knowing what to build

## My core stack

```ts
Frontend:   Next.js · Tailwind CSS · React Native  
Backend:    NestJS · Fastify · Prisma · PostgreSQL · Redis  
Infra:      Coolify · Cloudflare · GitHub Actions  
AI:         OpenAI · Gemini · Claude · n8n · LangChain
```


## A few things about me

I care about clear thinking and clean execution  
I prefer action over opinions  
I believe attention is earned through value  
And I build to learn
